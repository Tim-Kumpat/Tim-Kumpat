- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Tim-Kumpat from germany
- ðŸ‘€ I'm always open for new tech and I love learning new things.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently improving my front and backend skills with daily coding sessions
- ðŸ“« You can contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timkumpat/) or X (@TimKumpat)

I'm a 17 year old founder, self taught software engineer and high school student. I'm the founder of [Jump Apps](https://jump-apps.com) and [Jump Webdesign](https://jumpwebdesign.de/).

Personal projects will be published on this GitHub Account (Tim Kumpat) and every project related to Jump Apps will be published on the [Jump Apps organization profile](https://github.com/Jump-Apps).

When I was 13 years old I taught myself how to build websites. When I was 15 years old, I founded my own firm. A few days after my 17th birthday I signed the contract for my first software engineering internship.

If you have any questions or just wanna connect, feel free to reach out!
