I'm a 17 year old founder, self taught software engineer, web designer, graphic designer and high school student. I'm the founder of [Jump Apps](https://github.com/Jump-Apps) and [Jump Webdesign](https://jumpwebdesign.de/).

Personal projects will be published on this GitHub Account (Tim Kumpat) and every project related to Jump Apps will be published on the Jump Apps organization profile.
